<pre id=header>
A fresh university graduate passionate about
doing more with less. Enthusiastic about programming,
language, mathematics, and other forms of abstraction.
More than fifty-odd personal projects and counting!

project figure breakdown:
 + 20 (<a href=https://github.com/mogmc>https://github.com/mogmc</a>)
 + 27 (<a href=https://github.com/hywn>https://github.com/hywn</a>)
 + 3  (misc)

the line between 'project' and 'non-project' is a bit vague,
and I often don't bother actually uploading all projects
so I probably have more if I count closely.
